# euler
This repository is an online backup wich contains all the solutions I found for 
'project euler' problems (https://projecteuler.net)
Those solutions are mostly written in python3

If you had not yet solved euler problems published here, and you wanted to
try your own, I highly suggest to **NOT read** those solutions.

The code published on this repository is absolutely free-to-use for any kind of
usage, this is why I choosed the highly-permissive MIT license.
